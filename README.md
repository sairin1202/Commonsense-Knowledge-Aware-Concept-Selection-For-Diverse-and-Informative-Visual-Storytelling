This repository consists of two parts:
1) Concept Selection
2) Visual Storytelling


## Concept Selection
In the paper, we use the concept selection to first select the concepts for the story generation.

codes are involved under concept_selection/

run python train.py to train the model.


## Visual Storytelling

We use BART as pretrained model.

codes are involved under visualstorytelling/

run python train.py to train the model.
